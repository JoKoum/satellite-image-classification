## Satellite Image Classification
---
#### Semester project for the Deep Learning class of the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr/) by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus

The project utilizes the JPG version of the satellite images dataset [*Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space) and utilizes Multi-label classification approaches, investigating the application of Computer Vision algorithms at detecting phenomena like deforestation.

[Tensorflow v2 (Keras)](https://www.tensorflow.org/) platform was used for the neural networks creation. 

##### You can clone the project from repository using the following command:
